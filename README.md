# Junk Tools

This is a bunch of CLI "tools" made out of sheer boredom.

# Junk available:

## Joke
Fetches jokes from [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/). The API contains about 1300 jokes,
and they range from Programming Jokes, to Puns, to Dark jokes.

The CLI includes a way to select what category of jokes to get and a way to blacklist topics

### Usage
```
junk joke --type <all | custom> --category <category> --blacklist <blacklist>
```


## WIP Scroller
A extremely knock-off version of [CMatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix). Currently it can do nothing
